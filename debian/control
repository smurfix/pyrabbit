Description: A Pythonic interface to the RabbitMQ Management HTTP API
 .
 The main documentation lives at http://pyrabbit.readthedocs.org
 .
 There's no way to easily write programs against RabbitMQs management API
 without resorting to some messy urllib boilerplate code involving HTTP
 Basic authentication and parsing the JSON responses, etc. Pyrabbit
 abstracts this away & provides an intuitive, easy way to work with the
 data that lives inside of RabbitMQ, and manipulate the resources there.
